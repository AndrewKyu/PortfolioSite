# PortfolioSite

## Purpose
A portfolio website that showcases my accomplishments, expertise, and life experiences. 

## About
This project served as a foundation for me to refine and learn new fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This is a simple portfolio site that includes contents about me, my skills and experiences. Tools used for the front-end design are: HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Bootstrap. The backend was created using Node.JS and Express.JS to make HTTP requests for the contact form.
